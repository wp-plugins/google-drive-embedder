		<h3>Enterprise Version</h3>
		<p>Google Drive is a versatile way to store files and share with colleagues, while your intranet is clearer and 
		better structured for sharing more focused information. But using both at the same time can lead to confusion about 
		where information is stored.</p>

		<p>Wouldn't it be great if your intranet could be used to control and structure the information your organization
		 stores in Drive?</p>

		<p>Our Enterprise version of Google Drive Embedder integrates Drive much more closely with your WordPress intranet,
		 essentially allowing each page or post on your intranet to host its own file attachments, completely backed by 
		 Drive.</p>

		<p>This means you no longer need to manage Drive and your Intranet as two completely separate document sharing systems!
		</p>
		
		<p>Drive Embedder Enterprise has all the features of the premium and basic versions - easily embed files from Google Drive 
		into your WordPress site - plus much more advanced folder embedding. This starts with much slicker styling. 
		Instead of embedding folders as iframes, they are built directly into your WordPress pages, meaning users can
		click into subfolders and preview files without leaving your website.</p>
		
		<b>Includes support and updates for one year.</b>
